This page links to the published Governance API documentation and tools.

If you want to view the OpenAPI (Redoc) API viewer, open the standalone viewer in a new tab:

[Open Governance API viewer (Redoc)](https://bridgingknowledge.github.io/medibridge-governance-lite/gov-api/redoc.html){:target="_blank"}

Notes
-----
- The Governance API viewer is hosted in the `medibridge-governance-lite` repository and published via GitHub Pages.
- If you need an embedded view inside this hub, we can copy the viewer assets into this repository instead (requires maintenance).
