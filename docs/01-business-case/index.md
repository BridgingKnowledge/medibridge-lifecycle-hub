# 1 Business Case
 
## 🎯 Purpose
To justify the initiation of an AI‑assisted ultrasound system by aligning clinical value, economic feasibility, and regulatory strategy.

## 🧩 Scope
- Define the unmet clinical need (diagnostic bottlenecks, workload pressure).
- Select regulatory pathway: EU (MDR/IVDR, DKMA), US (FDA QSR/Part 11), or dual.
- Estimate lifecycle costs including validation, QMS, and post‑market surveillance.
- Assess risks (clinical, technical, regulatory, cybersecurity).
- Define expected outcomes and KPIs.

## 🔄 Process
1. **Problem definition**: High patient throughput, limited radiology capacity, delayed diagnosis.
2. **Clinical objectives**: Faster triage, reduced unnecessary scans, improved patient outcomes.
3. **Regulatory pathway decision**:
   - **EU**: MDR 2017/745, GDPR, ISO 13485/14971/62304/62366‑1.
   - **US**: FDA 21 CFR Part 820 (QSR), Part 11, HIPAA.
   - **GxP**: GAMP 5 risk‑based validation.
4. **Economic model**: CAPEX/OPEX, validation costs, supplier contracts.
5. **Approval**: Go/No‑Go decision with defined KPIs.

## 🧠 Professional language
> “The business case establishes the regulatory pathway (MDR vs FDA), quantifies lifecycle costs including validation and QMS, and demonstrates clinical/economic value aligned with ISO 13485 design controls.”

## 💬 Translation to reality
> “We prove it’s worth doing: show how AI ultrasound saves time and money, decide if we go EU, US, or both, and count the real costs of compliance before we start.”

## 📁 Outputs
- Regulatory pathway decision memo.
- Cost/benefit analysis including validation/QMS.
- Risk overview (clinical, technical, compliance).
- KPI baseline and success criteria.


**Scope**  
- Problem statement, success criteria, value/impact  
- Constraints (clinical, regulatory, budget, staffing)

**Process (short)**  
1) Define goals and measurable outcomes  
2) Identify constraints and assumptions  
3) Capture acceptance signals for “good enough”  

**Artifacts/Links**  
- Collaboration flow: `medibridge-collaboration-hub` (stakeholder inputs)  
- Product context: `medibridge-ultrasound-suite` (demo, architecture)
