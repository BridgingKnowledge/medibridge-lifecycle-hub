# Welcome to the MediBridge Lifecycle Hub

## Purpose
Establish a practical, end‑to‑end governance framework for clinical IT/medical software covering idea, design, risk, validation, operations, post‑market, and decommissioning, aligned to EU and US regulatory pathways and industry standards.

# 00 Introduction – MediBridge Lifecycle Hub

## 🌍 Why this project?
Medical imaging is powerful, but also resource‑intensive. Ultrasound examinations are often performed on large patient groups, even though only a fraction show clinically relevant findings. This creates bottlenecks, delays, and unnecessary workload for clinicians.

By combining **ultrasound technology** with **AI‑based decision support**, we aim to:
- **Optimize diagnostics**: AI pre‑screens images and flags potential abnormalities.
- **Streamline workflows**: Routine scans are triaged automatically, so clinicians focus on patients with suspected pathology.
- **Reduce costs**: Fewer unnecessary follow‑up exams, more efficient use of equipment and staff.
- **Improve patient outcomes**: Faster detection of relevant cases, shorter time to treatment.
- **Support healthcare systems**: Free up capacity in overstretched radiology and clinical departments.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Lifecycle Hub
This repository is not about building the AI itself. It is about **showing the full governance and lifecycle management** around such a system:
- How to move from idea → requirements → risk → validation → operations → decommissioning.
- How to ensure compliance with EU MDR, FDA QSR, GDPR/HIPAA, ISO 13485, ISO 14971, IEC 62304, and GAMP 5.
- How to bridge between clinicians, developers, QA, and regulators.

## 🧩 What problems does it solve?
- **For clinicians**: Less time wasted on normal scans, more focus on patients who need care.
- **For hospitals**: Documented compliance, predictable costs, and validated IT systems.
- **For patients**: Faster, safer, and more reliable diagnostics.
- **For regulators**: Transparent lifecycle documentation, risk management, and audit‑ready evidence.

## ✨ How to read this hub
- **Business Case (01)** explains why the system is worth building and which regulatory pathway to choose.
- **Regulatory & Stakeholders (02)** maps the rules and the people involved.
- **Requirements & Design (03)** translates needs into specifications.
- …and so on, through validation, operations, post‑market, and decommissioning.

## Scope
- **Lifecycle coverage:** Business case → Requirements/design → Risk/QMS → Validation → Security/IAM → Operations → Incidents/changes → PMS → BCP/DRP → Decommissioning.
- **Regulatory contexts:** EU (MDR/IVDR, GDPR, DKMA competent authority), US (FDA QSR/Part 11, HIPAA), and **GAMP 5** for GxP environments.
- **Standards baseline:** ISO 13485 (QMS), ISO 14971 (risk), IEC 62304 (software life cycle), IEC 62366‑1 (usability), ISO/IEC 27001 (infosec), ISO 25010 (software quality).

## Professional language
> “This hub defines a risk‑based, standards‑anchored lifecycle aligned with MDR/FDA expectations and quality system controls, ensuring traceability from stakeholder needs to validated, compliant releases.”

## Translation to reality
> “It’s the playbook: what to build, why it’s safe, how we prove it works, and what we do when something breaks — with the right rules for EU and/or US.”

## Roles and responsibilities
- **Sponsor:** Owns business case and funding.
- **Product owner:** Owns requirements and prioritization.
- **QA/RA lead:** Owns QMS, risk, validation, and compliance evidence.
- **Dev lead:** Owns architecture, implementation, and SDLC controls.
- **Clinical proxy:** Owns usability, workflows, UAT.
- **Security officer:** Owns IAM, GDPR/HIPAA and controls.
- **Ops lead:** Owns deployment, monitoring, incidents, changes.

## Key artefacts
- **Governance:** Quality plan, SOPs/work instructions (QMS).
- **Traceability:** REQ ↔ RSK (ISO 14971) ↔ TEST (VPL/VP/TR).
- **Validation:** Validation plan (VPL), protocols (VP), reports (TR), deviation logs.
- **Regulatory mapping:** EU/US applicability matrix, classification rationale.
- **Security:** DPIA, access model (least privilege/SoD), audit trail specs.
