## 1. European Union Regulatory Framework

### 1.1 EU MDR 2017/745 â€“ Medical Device Regulation

The device qualifies as a **Medical Device** under EU MDR, based on the definition in Article 2(1), due to its intended use for diagnostic purposes via image analysis and triaging.

- **Intended Use**: AI-assisted image triage tool to support clinical decision-making.
- **Risk Class**: Likely **Class IIa or IIb** under Rule 10 or Rule 11 of Annex VIII (based on the diagnostic function and AI decision-support).
- **Conformity Assessment Route**: Involves Notified Body review for Class IIa+.

### 1.2 General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR)

A GSPR checklist is maintained in alignment with **Annex I** of the MDR. Key relevant clauses include:

- **Chapter I**: General requirements (safety, performance, benefit-risk)
- **Chapter II**: Design and manufacturing
- **Chapter III**: Labelling, UDI, and instructions for use

### 1.3 Relevant Harmonized Standards

## 2. IT Compliance & Software Validation

### 2.1 GAMP 5 â€“ Software Validation for Computerized Systems

GAMP 5 principles are applied to define the software category, establish lifecycle documentation, and validate the system according to risk:

- **System Type**: Category 4 or 5 (complex/configurable/custom software)
- **Validation Deliverables**:
  - URS (User Requirements Specification)
  - FS (Functional Specification)
  - Design Specifications
  - IQ/OQ/PQ Protocols
  - Traceability Matrix

### 2.2 IEC 82304-1 â€“ Health Software Safety

This standard supports safety and security for stand-alone health software:

- Emphasizes **product-level safety** over lifecycle
- Integrates quality, safety, and usability assurance
- Used in conjunction with **IEC 62304** and **ISO 14971**

### 2.3 ISO/IEC 27001 & 27701 â€“ Information Security & Privacy

These standards guide the implementation of an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** and **Privacy Information Management System (PIMS)**:

- **ISO/IEC 27001**: Asset management, access control, incident response
- **ISO/IEC 27701**: Privacy protection aligned with GDPR
- Supports risk-based approach to information assets used in development, deployment, and hosting of the AI system

## 3. Cybersecurity & NIS2 Compliance

### 3.1 EU MDR Annex I â€“ Cybersecurity Requirements

Cybersecurity is embedded as a **general safety requirement** in MDR:

- **Annex I, Section 17.2**: Devices must be designed to prevent unauthorized access and ensure secure data exchange
- Requirements include:
  - Authentication mechanisms
  - Data integrity and confidentiality
  - Protection against malware and unauthorized access

### 3.2 ISO/IEC 81001-5-1 â€“ Cybersecurity in Health Software

This standard outlines lifecycle-based **secure development practices** for health software and health IT systems:

- Threat modeling and risk assessment
- Secure coding and hardening
- Logging, auditability, and post-market monitoring

### 3.3 EU NIS2 Directive â€“ Critical Infrastructure Protection

The system and its operator may fall under **NIS2 obligations** if:

- The company qualifies as an "important" or "critical" entity
- The system handles sensitive health data and connects to networks

#### NIS2 Key Requirements:
- Implement cybersecurity risk management measures
- Conduct regular vulnerability assessments
- Report security incidents within **24 hours**
- Governance and accountability at **management level**

## 4. Stakeholder Engagement

| Stakeholder Type     | Role & Responsibility                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Clinical End Users   | Define usability, clinical validation, feedback loop   |
| QARA Teams           | Compliance ownership, PMS, vigilance, audit readiness  |
| IT Security          | NIS2 compliance, ISMS implementation                   |
| Software Engineers   | IEC 62304, 81001, GAMP 5 adherence                     |
| Data Protection Officer | GDPR and ISO 27701 implementation                  |
| Notified Body        | MDR conformity assessment                              |
