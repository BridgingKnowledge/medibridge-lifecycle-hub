# MediBridge Lifecycle Hub

> **What this is:** The landing repository for the entire MediBridge portfolio.  
> It explains the governance lifecycle end-to-end and links to the other repositories.

## Why it matters
- Shows capabilities **beyond QA**: structure, documentation, governance, and risk.  
- Makes complex clinical/IT topics **clear** for clinicians, engineers, and leadership.  
- Demonstrates **traceability** from requirements → risk → validation → operations.

## Start here
- **See product & traceability** → `medibridge-ultrasound-suite`
- **See governance & collaboration flow** → `medibridge-collaboration-hub`
- **See risk templates & examples** → `risk-assessment-templates`
 - **See governance tools & demos** → `medibridge-governance-lite`

## What this repository contains
- `docs/` — lifecycle chapters (one folder per topic)
- `flows/` — simple Mermaid diagrams for the overall lifecycle and change triage
- `mkdocs.yml` — optional site navigation (GitHub Pages)

> Maintenance: This hub follows the rules in [`PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS1.md`](./PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS1.md).
